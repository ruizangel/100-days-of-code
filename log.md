# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Day 1:** May 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started with Ray Wenderlich (raywenderlich.com) Swift Course, finish with Part 1: Core Concepts.

**Thoughts:** When through how to use Swift Playgrounds, tuples, booleans and scope, starting easy but feeling confident that I will be doing well during the course.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
